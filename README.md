Overview \n
This project simulates an invisibility cloak effect using a webcam and real-time color detection. The effect is achieved by removing a specific color (e.g., light blue or light green) from the video feed and replacing it with the background, making the object with that color appear invisible.

Technologies Used
Python: For building the project.

OpenCV: For real-time video processing and color detection.

HSV color space: Used for accurate color detection.

Features
Real-time background replacement: Replaces the detected color (e.g., light blue or light green) with the background, simulating the invisibility effect.

Customizable color detection: Easily modify the color range to suit your preferred cloak color.

Uses webcam input: Detects and processes the video feed from your webcam.
