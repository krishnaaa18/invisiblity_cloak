ðŸŒŸ Invisibility Cloak Effect ðŸŒŸ
ðŸ“¸ Overview
The Invisibility Cloak Effect simulates the magical Harry Potter cloak using computer vision! By detecting a specific color (e.g., light blue or light green) through your webcam feed, the object wearing that color becomes invisible. Itâ€™s like magic, but powered by OpenCV and Python! âœ¨

This project leverages real-time background subtraction to replace the selected color with the background, creating an invisibility effect.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Real-Time Color Detection: Detects and replaces a specific color in real-time.

Customizable Cloak Colors: Easily change the color of the cloak to suit your preferences.

Background Removal: Removes the selected color from the frame and replaces it with the background.

Webcam Integration: Works with your webcam for live, interactive effects!

âš¡ Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to create this effect.

OpenCV: A powerful library for computer vision tasks, such as color detection and background processing.

NumPy: For array handling and mathematical operations.
